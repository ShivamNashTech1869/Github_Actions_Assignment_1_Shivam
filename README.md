# GitHub Actions Assignment

This repository contains the code and configuration files for the GitHub Actions Assignment.

## Introduction

The GitHub Actions Assignment focuses on creating a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline includes running a Postman collection, executing Selenium tests, and running a Scala code using SBT. The pipeline is designed to automate the testing and deployment process.

## Getting Started

To get started with the GitHub Actions Assignment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

       git clone https://github.com/shivamknoldus1869/Github_Actions_Assignment_1_Shivam.git

2. Set up the required environment and tools for running the Postman collection, Selenium tests, and SBT project. This may include installing Node.js, Newman, Maven, Java, and SBT.

3. Customize the Postman collection (CURD.postman_collection.json) to suit your needs. Modify the API endpoints, request payloads, and test assertions according to your application requirements.

4. Review and update the `.github/workflows/postman-ci.yaml` file to configure the GitHub Actions pipeline. Ensure that the correct paths to the Postman collection file, Selenium tests, and Scala code are specified.

5. Open the project in your preferred code editor to make any necessary modifications.

6. Commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository.

## Manual Run Workflow Steps

If you want to manually trigger the GitHub Actions workflow and run the pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Go to the main page of your GitHub repository.

2. Click on the "Actions" tab at the top of the repository.

3. In the left sidebar, click on the workflow name (e.g., "GitHub_Aaction").

4. Click on the "Run workflow" button.

5. Select the branch you want to run the workflow on.

6. Click on the "Run workflow" button to start the manual run.

7. Monitor the progress of the workflow in the GitHub Actions interface.

## Workflow Execution Order

The GitHub Actions pipeline is designed to run the jobs sequentially based on the success status of the previous job. The execution order is as follows:

1. Postman Collection Execution: This job runs the Postman collection and generates a test report.

2. Selenium Test Execution: This job executes the Selenium tests and generates a test report.

3. SBT Project Execution: This job compiles and runs the Scala code using SBT.

Please note that each job will only start if the previous job succeeds. If any job fails, the subsequent jobs will not be executed.

## Test Reports

After the GitHub Actions workflow completes, you can access the test reports generated by the Postman collection and Selenium tests. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the main page of your GitHub repository.

2. Click on the "Actions" tab at the top of the repository.

3. In the left sidebar, click on the workflow name (e.g., "GitHub_Action").

4. Click on the latest workflow run to view the details.

5. In the workflow run details, click on the "Artifacts" section.

6. Download the test report artifacts such as the Postman test report (e.g., `report.html`) and the Selenium test report (e.g., `emailable-report.html`).

7. Open the downloaded test reports to view the test results.

## Conclusion

The GitHub Actions Assignment provides a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for testing and deploying your applications. It automates the testing process, allowing you to catch bugs and issues early in the development cycle. By leveraging the power of GitHub Actions, you can ensure the quality and reliability of your software projects.
