# GitHub Actions Assignment(1+2)

This repository contains the code and configuration files for the GitHub Actions Assignment 1+2.

## Introduction

The GitHub Actions Assignment focuses on creating a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Newman for running a Postman collection, as well as running Selenium tests. The pipeline is designed to automate the execution of the Postman collection and Selenium tests, and generate test reports for both.

## Getting Started

To get started with the GitHub Actions Assignment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/shivamknoldus1869/Github_Actions_Assignment_1_Shivam.git
    ```

2. Set up the required environment and tools for running the Postman collection and Selenium tests. This may include installing Node.js, Newman, Java, and any other dependencies.

3. Customize the Postman collection (CURD.postman_collection.json) to suit your needs. Modify the API endpoints, request payloads, and test assertions according to your application requirements.

4. Review and update the `.github/workflows/postman-ci.yaml` file to configure the GitHub Actions pipeline. Ensure that the correct paths to the Postman collection file and Newman command are specified.

5. Review and update the `.github/workflows/postman-ci.yaml` file to include the necessary steps for running Selenium tests. Make sure to specify the correct Java version and other configuration options.

6. Open the project in your preferred code editor to make any necessary modifications.

7. Commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository.

## Manual Run Workflow Steps

If you want to manually trigger the GitHub Actions workflow and run the Postman collection and Selenium tests, follow these steps:

1. Go to the main page of your GitHub repository.

2. Click on the "Actions" tab at the top of the repository.

3. In the left sidebar, click on the workflow name (e.g., "CI/CD Pipeline").

4. Click on the "Run workflow" button.

5. Select the branch you want to run the workflow on.

6. Click on the "Run workflow" button to start the manual run.

7. Monitor the progress of the workflow in the GitHub Actions interface.

## Report Steps

After the GitHub Actions workflow completes, you can access the test reports generated by Newman and Selenium. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the main page of your GitHub repository.

2. Click on the "Actions" tab at the top of the repository.

3. In the left sidebar, click on the workflow name (e.g., "Postman CI").

4. Click on the latest workflow run to view the details.

5. In the workflow run details, click on the "Artifacts" section.

6. Download the test report artifacts, such as `report.html` for the Postman collection and `emailable-report.html` for the Selenium tests.

7. Open the downloaded test reports to view the test results.

**Note:** The Postman test report artifact is stored with the name **"test-report"**, and the Selenium test report artifact is stored with the name **"selenium-report"**.

That's it! You now have the instructions for running both the Postman collection and Selenium code using the GitHub Actions workflow. Happy testing!
